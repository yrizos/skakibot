# SkakiBot ♟️🤖

A command-line chess game where you play against an AI. Built with `python-chess` and OpenAI.

(In case you're wondering, "Skaki" is the Greek word for chess.)

## Setup

You need an OpenAI API key. Get it from [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
```
